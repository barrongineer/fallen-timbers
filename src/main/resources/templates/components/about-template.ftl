                Fallen Timbers was born out of a family’s passion for
                home décor, eye for design, and a can-do attitude.
                Our pieces are made from a mix of new and reclaimed
                wood. We’re always on the hunt for unusual reclaimed
                timber, recovered from abandoned industrial buildings
                and farmhouses. We love the challenge of taking
                something old and upcycling it into something new and
                stylish!

                The Fallen Timbers design is inspired by the modern
                farmhouse. From our furniture to artwork, we pride
                ourselves in the fact that each of our items is uniquely
                handcrafted, without mass production. When you take
                one of our contemporary rustic pieces home, you will
                have a one-of-a-kind item.
